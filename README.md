FOR INTEL ONE API PROJECT PURPOSE
## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
# About Dataset
# Context
This Dataset is being collected by Yahoo Finance.

# Content
This dataset contains daily market closing prices of Bitcoin, Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and London Stock Exchange. Additionally, the dataset includes the daily volume of Bitcoin and the three markets. The dataset offers an opportunity for researchers and analysts to explore the relationship between the prices and volumes of these financial markets. By analyzing this data, users can gain valuable insights into the behavior and trends of the cryptocurrency and traditional stock markets, which can inform investment strategies and decision-making.

# Data Collecting Strategy
The data collection strategy for this dataset involves gathering daily market closing prices and volume data of Bitcoin, Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and London Stock Exchange. It should be noted that although Bitcoin is traded 24/7, the data is collected based on trading days of the New York Stock Exchange. This ensures that the data is consistent and comparable across all markets, allowing for accurate analysis and insights. The data is collected from reliable sources and is intended for analytical purposes.
# Why the Analysis?
One of the major problems with many price predictions about Bitcoin is that they lack sufficient analytical support to back up their claims. An outlandish price point, particularly one in the upward direction, is always going to be tempting to investors; someone holding a cryptocurrency currently priced at $0.01 can easily be swayed to believe that the token will skyrocket to $10,000 simply because they want it to be true. However, the issue is that many predictions are delivered without evidence and analysis to support them.

The macroeconomist Peter Tchir believes that Bitcoin price forecasts, in particular, are overhyped. In 2018 a profile in Forbes, Tchir said that some prominent figures in the industry who push for sky-high prices are doing so for reasons that may not be linked to fundamentals. When a CEO of a popular exchange calls for a Bitcoin price that is significantly higher than what it is valued at today, Tchir suggests, it could be that the CEO is pushing their own "strong incentives to see crypto thrive."
